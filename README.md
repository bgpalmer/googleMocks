# Learning Googletest and Googlemocks

I am testing the shape class with a unit test(shape_test.cpp). It's only the beginning but I'm planning to test the area and perimeter functions. The build system is contained in the makefile provided by the google test framework on my local machine. To use these file, one should first download google test. Then, after downloading these file, include the path to these downloaded files in the makefile provided by the framework, and create a recipe similar to the sample unit test the framework provides to get a working executable.
